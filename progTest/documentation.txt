This is my book app,

Pretty simple in design and run.

Simply, I have an... 
- index.html 
- a root module with controller that implements $http calls, storing data
- also i have views for the different pages
- and some css for tidying up the author pannels 
- using Agular route, i dowloaded the angular & bootstap files 

Everthing else is pretty straight-forward, should work no issue.

progTest folder in localhost folder... 

URL: http://localhost/progTest/index.html#/first

Cheers,
